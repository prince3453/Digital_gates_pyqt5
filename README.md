# Simulation of Gates
This project is focused on the simulation of fundamental logic gates, providing a visual and interactive way to understand the basic building blocks of digital circuits. The software simulates the behavior of gates like AND, OR, and XOR, allowing users to explore the truth tables and logic operations in a user-friendly environment.

## Features
- Interactive simulation of various logic gates.
- Real-time truth table generation.
- Easy-to-use interface for experimenting with different gate combinations.
- Visual representation of input and output signals.
